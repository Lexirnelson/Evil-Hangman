The biggest challenges I encountered with this project was implementing an algorithm to
find every possible letter combo, and merging the possible combinations with the current
word. To overcome this problem, I really just had to push through, and approach them from
several different angles. Specifically for the merging, I just had to finagle with the
setup of the loops. I actually really enjoyed this assignment, no complaints. I spent 16
hours on this assignment.
