This program uses recursion and mapping to make a game of hangman nearly impossible
to win. The user chooses the length of the word, which limits the usable dictionary
for the program. Then, the user will start guessing letters, and the program will 
choose a group of words from the map based off of the map key with the most words in
it. The words for each key are generated using a recursive function which finds all
possible combinations for each possible letter combination. The portion of code 
created by me is the hangman.cpp and hangman.h.
